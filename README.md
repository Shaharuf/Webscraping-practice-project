# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data by Webscraping
This project involves building a Python program that extracts historical stock data from a website and visualizes it using charts and graphs. This can help individuals and businesses analyze stock performance over time and make informed investment decisions.

# Prerequisites
To use this project, you will need:
> Python 3.x
> The beautifulsoup4 library
> The pandas library
> The matplotlib library

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:
pip install beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib

# Installation
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username}/extract-visualize-stock-data.git

# Usage
Step 1: Scrape stock data
Open the scrape_stock_data.py file and modify the url variable to the website containing the stock data you want to scrape. Then run the file to scrape the data and store it in a CSV file.
python scrape_stock_data.py

Step 2: Visualize stock data
Open the visualize_stock_data.py file and modify the filename variable to the name of the CSV file containing the scraped data. Then run the file to generate visualizations.
python visualize_stock_data.py
